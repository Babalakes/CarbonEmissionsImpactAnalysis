# üåç **Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis**

## üìë **Overview**

This project explores the impact of **carbon emissions** on global temperatures by analyzing historical trends, detecting anomalies, and simulating future scenarios. The analysis aims to uncover correlations between rising **CO‚ÇÇ concentrations** and **temperature anomalies**, providing actionable insights to inform sustainable policies and address **climate change**.

---

## üìä **Datasets**

Two primary datasets are used:

1. **Annual Global Temperature Changes**

   - Annual temperature anomalies across multiple countries and decades.

2. **Monthly CO‚ÇÇ Concentrations**
   - Global monthly CO‚ÇÇ measurements, highlighting seasonal and long-term variations.

By combining these datasets, we analyze historical trends, detect anomalies, and explore ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios.

## üöÄ **Project Objectives**

The project focuses on the following key objectives:

1. **Historical Analysis**

   - Identify trends in **CO‚ÇÇ concentrations** and **temperature anomalies** over time.
   - Analyze the increasing rate of CO‚ÇÇ emissions compared to temperature changes.

2. **Anomaly Detection**

   - Highlight significant deviations caused by natural or anthropogenic events (e.g., volcanic eruptions, industrialization).

3. **Predictive Modeling & Scenario Simulation**
   - Build models to simulate ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios and predict temperature changes under varying CO‚ÇÇ levels.
   - Explore the **sensitivity of global temperatures** to modest reductions or increases in emissions.

## üîç **Summary of Findings**

Our analysis uncovers the following insights:

1. **Strong Positive Correlation**

   - Rising **CO‚ÇÇ concentrations** are strongly correlated with **global temperature anomalies**, with emissions increasing faster than temperature changes.

2. **Escalating Trends and Seasonal Variations**

   - Time-series and clustering analyses reveal a clear escalation in emissions driving temperature increases.
   - Seasonal variations underscore the moderating role of **natural carbon sinks** like oceans and forests.

3. **Lagged Effects**

   - Current CO‚ÇÇ levels have the most significant impact on temperature changes, while the influence of past emissions diminishes over time.

4. **What-If Scenarios**
   - Simulations demonstrate that global temperatures are highly sensitive to changes in CO‚ÇÇ concentrations.
   - Even **modest reductions in emissions** could significantly mitigate global warming.

These findings highlight the urgent need for **actionable policies** to effectively address climate change.
